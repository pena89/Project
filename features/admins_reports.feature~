Feature: Creating Reports

As an administrator I want to create reports with the database of cadets that are currently in the MathLab

Background:
 Given I am on the homepage
  When I select "admin" from "rank" 
  And I fill in "Name" with "Pena" 
  And I fill in "Email" with "penal1@citadel.edu"
  And I fill in "Password" with "qwer"
  And I fill in "Password confirmation" with "qwer"
  And I press "Register"
  And I should see "Reports"
