Project
=======

For this project, we are designing an application that will take the current Math Lab sign-in process and make it completely
automated. 

The current process is that the head of the Math Lab needs to correct sheets from the Math Lab every day and manually
input those students into a database. Then she is suppose to turn in a weekly and monthly report of the students who attend
the Math Lab sessions to several different people.

We decided to create a simple application that allows students to sign in and that infomation will then be able to be exported to
an excel document that can be used for any purpose.

As of 12/15/2014 we were able to create and Admin account that allows the Math Lab head to manually add students to the database.
We also added the ability for an weekly and monthlky formatted excel sheet to be produced once the students login.
